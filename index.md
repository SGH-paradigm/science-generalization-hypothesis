# Welcome to the SGH Paradigm

The **Science Generalization Hypothesis (SGH)** is a conceptual and mathematical framework aimed at unifying principles across scientific domains — including physics, mathematics, and ontology of motion.

This site serves as a reference point for SGH development, documentation, and research publication.

## Overview

- 📚 **Documentation**: Browse through definitions, axioms, and model structures.
- ⚙️ **Mathematical Formulations**: Explore the formal language underpinning SGH.
- 🧠 **Ontological Foundations**: Understand the deep conceptual assumptions of the framework.
